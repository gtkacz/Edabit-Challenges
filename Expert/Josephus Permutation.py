# A group of n prisoners stand in a circle awaiting execution. Starting from an arbitrary position(0), the executioner kills every kth person until one person remains standing, who is then granted freedom (see examples).

# Create a function that takes 2 arguments â€” the number of people to be executed n, and the step size k, and returns the original position (index) of the person who survives.
